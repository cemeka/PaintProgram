                                                                   Paint Project Release Notes

System Requirements
•	The program is designed to be compatible with any operating system that runs the more recent versions of Java. There is a small amount of hard-coding in the program. (However, the hard-coded items are essential parts of the program which cannot be generated by the user while running the program. One such example was a plain white background picture, which served as the platform for drawing.  All pictures referenced in the program are stored in the same directory as the java files themselves, meaning that the code will run smoothly on any machine).
•	The client must have a working Java Virtual Machine and javac compiler in order to run the program.

Working Features
•	The program allows a client to open a file stored locally on their computer
•	The program allows a client to open a file stored on the Internet
•	The program allows a client to save an image to any local directory of their choosing.
•	The program always asks clients if they would like to save changes to an image (if any were made) before it opens a new picture from the Internet or from a local directory. 
•	The Quit menu item in the program allows a client to exit the program, and is intelligent in that it can determine when an image has been edited, and ask a user if (s)he would like to save the modified image before exiting.
•	The program allows a client to draw straight lines in any color of their choosing.
•       A pencil feature is present in the program. Drawings can be made on top of pictures in any color of the client’s choosing.
•	The client can draw irregular shapes and write on a picture.
•       An eraser can be selected by the client in order to erase a part of a picture. 
•	The client can paint the entire picture itself to any one color (i.e. a picture of a white background could be filled with paint and converted to a green or yellow background). 
•	A select tool has been added to the program. This allows a client to select an area of a picture (s)he would like to crop.
•	A “Move Cropped Image” menu option has been provided in the program. It allows the client to move a portion of an image to anywhere else on the image the client chooses. It works in conjunction with the select tool.
•	Improvements to GUI aesthetics have been implemented to enhance the client’s experience. For instance, an actual pencil image is displayed and used as a cursor if a client selects the “Draw with Pencil” menu item. 

Known Issues
•	The application only prompts the client to save before exiting if he/she tries to exit by clicking the Quit option in the File Menu. 
        It doesn't prompt the client to save if they try to exit by clicking the X button. This needs to be changed.  


Observations and Notes
The program strictly follows OO programming practice in that it divides tasks  and functions appropriately and in a logical fashion. It is easy to add new menu items to the Edit menu.
