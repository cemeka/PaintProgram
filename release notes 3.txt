                                                                   Paint Project Release Notes

System Requirements
•	The client must have a working Java Virtual Machine and javac compiler in order to run the program. (Program written with Java SE 7)

Working Features
•	The program allows a client to open a file stored locally on their computer
•	The program allows a client to open a file stored on the Internet
•	The program allows a client to save an image to any local directory of their choosing.
•	The program always asks clients if they would like to save changes to an image (if any were made) before it opens a new picture from the Internet or from a local directory. 
•	The Quit menu item in the program allows a client to exit the program, and is intelligent in that it can determine when an image has been edited, and ask a user if (s)he would like to save the modified image before exiting.
•	The program allows a client to draw straight lines in any color of their choosing.
•       A pencil feature is present in the program. Drawings can be made on top of pictures in any color of the client’s choosing.
•	The client can draw irregular shapes and write on a picture.
•       An eraser can be selected by the client in order to erase a part of a picture. 
•	The client can paint the entire picture itself to any one color (i.e. a picture of a white background could be filled with paint and converted to a green or yellow background). 
•	A select tool has been added to the program. This allows a client to select an area of a picture (s)he would like to crop.
•	A “Move Cropped Image” menu option has been provided in the program. It allows the client to move a portion of an image to anywhere else on the image the client chooses. It works in conjunction with the select tool.
•	Improvements to GUI aesthetics have been implemented to enhance the client’s experience. For instance, an actual pencil image is displayed and used as a cursor if a client selects the “Draw with Pencil” menu item. 

Known Issues
•	The application only prompts the client to save before exiting if he/she tries to exit by clicking the Quit option in the File Menu. 
        It doesn't prompt the client to save if they try to exit by clicking the X button. This needs to be changed.  


Observations and Notes
The program strictly follows OO programming practice in that it divides tasks  and functions appropriately and in a logical fashion. It is easy to add new menu items to the Edit menu.
