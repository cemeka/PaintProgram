Comments for Paint Project

-The program allows a user to draw simple lines, as well as irregular shapes and marks on a picture in any color of their choosing.  
-The program has added functionality, the most preeminent of which is giving a client the ability to use a select tool.  

-The code needs to be changed so as to prompt the user to save their work if they haven't before exiting when they click the "X" button. 
 When they exit through the Quit menu option, it asks them to save their work but it doesn't do so when one exits through the "X" button. 
-It's possible for the user to change the default picture. This shouldn't be allowed. The program needs to be changed to prevent it.
